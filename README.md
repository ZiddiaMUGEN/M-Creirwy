You need to install the `mdk-mugen` Python package to build this character.

Run `python MakeDevils.py` to build the devil's eye common states, then run `python MakeCreirwy.py` to build the other states.

The character code sits in the `source` folder, and the character's animations, sprites, sounds, etc. live in the `System` folder. The compiled character code goes into `M-Creirwy.CNS`.
